# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

The primary goal of this repository is to store and organize my solutions to various LeetCode problems and classical algorithms, all written in **TypeScript**.
By solving these algorithmic challenges and implementing well-known algorithms, I aim to improve my proficiency in TypeScript while deepening my understanding of algorithmic concepts.
This repository serves as a way to both practice and track my progress in mastering both the language and common algorithmic techniques.
